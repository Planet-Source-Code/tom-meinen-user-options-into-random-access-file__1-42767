## User Options into Random Access File


</div>

### Description

If you would prefer not to fool around with the Windows Registry, you can save a user's options in a random access file instead. Random access files are fast (much faster than database files) and allow you to organize the user uptions as database-like records that may be accessed separately from one another. You can overwrite a single record without affecting or even needing to read the others.

This code also shows how to give the user a right-click option to change the size of or hide the toolbar. Finally, it shows an optional splash screen. If your users hate splash screens (most do), but your graphic artist insists that you include one, give the user the option of shutting it off.

Note: You need the icons included in this zip file for this code to run right.
